Adds a few simple utility methods to Array and ActiveRecord

Array#randomize
======

returns the array's elements in random order

Example:
[1,2,3].randomize # => [2,3,1]
[1,2,3].randomize # => [1,3,2]
...



ActiveRecord::Base.randomly_select
======

Useful for selecting random elements if 'order' is already used for scoping.

Example:
A blog has posts. Posts can be "liked".
We want to show our users which posts are popular.
Instead of always displaying the same 5 post with the most "likes", we want a random selection of the 50 most liked ones.

Post.randomly_select({:limit =>5}, {:order => 'like_count'})
# => Post.all(:order => 'like_count', :limit => 50).randomize.first(5)

You can also specify the factor (10 per default)

Post.randomly_select({:limit => 5, :factor => 30}, :order => 'like_count')
# => Post.all(:order => 'like_count', :limit => 150).randomize.first(5)

Of course this also works with scopes
Post.published.order_by('like_count').randomly_select(:limit => 4)

THIS would make NO sense
Post.randomly_select(:limit => 5)

Use MySQL's RAND() instead: 
Post.all(:order => 'RAND()', :limit => '5')
